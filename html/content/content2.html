    <h1 class="center">Vim is</h1>
    <p class="vim">Vim a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program for
      Unix.
      It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, derived Vim from a port of the Stevie
      editor for
      Amiga and released a version to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and
      as
      a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is released under the Vim license that includes some
      charityware
      clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. The Vim license is
      compatible
      with the GNU General Public License through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies under the
      GNU GPL
      version 2.0 or later. Since its release for the Amiga, cross-platform development has made it available on many
      other
      systems. In 2006, it was voted the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal readers in 2015 the Stack Overflow
      developer
      survey found it to be the third most popular text editor, and in 2019 the fifth most popular development
      environment.</p>
