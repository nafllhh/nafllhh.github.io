      <p>lorem Ipsum is <em>simply</em> dummy <b>text</b> of the printing and typesettingindustry. <br />Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br />when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br />It has survived not only five centuries, but also the <b>leap</b> into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br />It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheetscontaining Lorem Ipsum passages, <br />and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMakerincluding versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
